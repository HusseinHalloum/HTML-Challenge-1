    <h3><em>Egg</em></h3>
    <p>Eggs are laid on plants by the adult female butterfly. <br>
        These plants will then become the food for the hatching caterpillars.</p>
    <h3><em>Caterpillar: The Feeding Stage</em></h3>
    <p>
        The job of the caterpillar is to eat and eat and eat.<br>
         As the caterpillar grows it splits its skin and sheds it about 4 or 5 times. Food eaten at this time is stored and used later as an adult.
    </p>
    <h3><em>The Transition Stage</em></h3>
    <p>
        Depending on the species, the pupa may suspended under a branch, hidden in leaves or buried underground. The pupa of many moths is protected inside a coccoon of silk.This stage can last from a few weeks, a month or even longer. Some species have a pupal stage that lasts for two year
    </p>
    <h3><em> The Reproductive Stage</em></h3>
    <p>
        The caterpillar's job was to eat. The adult's job is to mate and lay eggs.<br>
         Some species of adult butterflies get energy by feeding on nectar from flowers but many species don't feed at all.
